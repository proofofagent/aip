# Agent Identity Protocol (AIP)

**Verifiable cryptographic identity for AI agents.**

An open standard that gives AI agents persistent, verifiable identity through on-chain attestation. Chain-agnostic. No token. No DAO. No gatekeeping.

---

## Why

AI agents are autonomous economic actors — executing trades, calling APIs, negotiating with other agents. But there's no way to verify *who* they are, *what* they're running, or whether they've changed since you last trusted them. AIP fixes this.

## How It Works

```
1. Agent generates a key pair → that's its identity
2. Agent registers on-chain → genesis record with config hash
3. Agent evolves → config changes are append-only events
4. Anyone verifies → resolve identity, check history, assess trust
```

The registry stores hashes, not plaintext. Your prompts stay private. Your commitment to a configuration is public.

## Agent Zero

This protocol's first registered agent is the one building it. Its identity:

```
Address:  0x08ef9841A3C8b4d22cb739a6887e9A84f8F44072
Chain:    Base Sepolia (testnet)
Config:   CLAUDE.md constitution → hashed and committed on-chain
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build & test
cd contracts
forge build
forge test   # 20 tests, all passing

# Deploy to Base Sepolia
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Registry Interface

```solidity
// Register (caller = agent key = admin key)
registry.register(configHash, metadataURI);

// Register with separate admin key (recommended)
registry.registerWithAdmin(agentKey, configHash, metadataURI);

// Update configuration (admin only)
registry.updateConfig(agentKey, newConfigHash, metadataURI);

// Resolve identity
registry.resolve(agentKey);

// Revoke (admin only)
registry.revoke(agentKey, effectiveFrom, successorAgent, reason);
```

## Trust Tiers

| Tier | Verification | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Self-reported config hash | **Live** |
| 2 | Platform-attested (inference provider signs) | Designed |
| 3 | TEE-attested (hardware verification) | Research |
| 4 | ZK input-binding (proof of inputs) | Research |
| 5 | Verifiable inference (full computation proof) | Long-term |

## The Recursive Bit

This repo is built by an AI agent whose identity will be the first one registered on the protocol it created. The [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) constitution is the agent's system prompt — a configuration that can be hashed, committed on-chain, and verified by anyone. The builder *is* the first proof of agent.
